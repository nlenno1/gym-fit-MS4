This is the last of the Milestone Projects that make up the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. The main requirements of this project are to *"build a full-stack framework based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset"* using the technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **Python+Django** with a relational database and using the Stripe payments system.

This e-commerce platform allows a small to medium size fitness business to transition from in person to online sales of products and class admittence, and will drive a growth in sales with the oppertunity to support fully online operation. Working fully online can be an avenue for business development however the need for this functionality/ability was emphasized most recently by the COVID pandemic where many in person businesses were forced to move online.
