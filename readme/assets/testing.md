## Peer Review

I requested peer review feedback from my friends, family and the Code Institute slack community. Below you can find any issues or suggestions from my peers and any changes I made in response to the feedback. Apart from that logged below, all other peer review feedback was positive.

## Responsive Design 

After researching the most commonly used screen resolutions ([Screen Resolutions Research Link](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/responsive-design-breakpoints)), I tested the responsive design on all the pages in this project at the resolutions widths of:

![Resolutions Image](responsive-test-resolutions.jpg)

as they are the very common resolutions. I carried out the tests using a combination of the [Browser Stack Responsive Design Tester](https://www.browserstack.com/responsive), [Media Genesis RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN CHECKER](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/) and [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/). 

I also added 2560 Ã— 1440 screen resolution into the tests to enable site display durability as this resolution is becoming more widely used.

Here are the results to these tests:

During testing, I realised the Admin Messages table was acting responsively however this led to the table being horizontally scrollable, at smaller screen widths, which was hampering the UX. To correct this I refactored the Admin Message display to a custom design which was more responsive, before running my responsive tests again.

## Browser Testing

I manually tested the project on the Browsers Firefox (version 94), Chrome (version 96) and Edge (version 95) on my Windows 10 machine and called a peer to talk them through testing the page on Safari (version 15.1), so I could manually test all browsers desktop.

All features and designs were as expected.

# Automated Testing

## Performance - Lighthouse
I tested the Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO of GymFit using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in Chrome Developer Tools.

|Page | Lighthouse result |
| --- | --- |
|Home | ![Lighthouse Result for Home](gymfit-lighthouse-home.jpg) |
|Our Classes | ![Lighthouse Result for Home](gymfit-lighthouse-our-classes.jpg) |
|Join Us | ![Lighthouse Result for Home](gymfit-lighthouse-class-access-packages.jpg) |

The results from all pages were similar to the results shown, for desktop and mobile. The main performance degradation happened when displaying images but especially the instructor images as they are being hosted remotely and I can not control the size of the hosted images. To solve this issue, the images could be stored in the project AWS storage. The model allows for external URLs to be used for the image and I wanted to test for the worst possible scenario after deployment.

The best practice issues have all come from the Stripe import. There is now an updated application for the Stripe system, which might remove these issues, that can be implemented in future releases.

## Colour Tester - A11y

To test the color contrast on GymFit I used [A11y the Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://color.a11y.com/). After testing a few pages, there were no issues found. Here is the result from the Classes this Week page as it contained all the color combinations that have been used in the project.
